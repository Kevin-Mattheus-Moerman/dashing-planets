#Dashing Planets

##The 1-2-Go

To play with the planet data, just clone the repo down to your machine. If you have a Mac, you can run the code quickly with this: `python planet_dataframe.py` in your terminal, and then copy the local server address it provides you when it boots up. For a Windows machine, follow the link provided [here](http://pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/).

Note: If you brew Python, you might need to use `python2` or `python3` instead of just `python` depending on how you've set up your dev environment.
